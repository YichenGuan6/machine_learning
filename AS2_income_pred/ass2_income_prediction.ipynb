You can use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",

    "**(c)** Assume that your best classifier will be deployed in a bank to decide whether a customer will be granted a loan, or not. A loan will be granted if the classifier predicts an income of \">50K\", othewise it won't. The bank manager wants to avoid falsely granting a loan to an applicant with insufficient income by all means. Can you reassure the bank manager with the evaluation results in Q7 that your classifier is adequate? If not, describe an alternative evaluation metric and explain why it is more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** Do you observe a clear difference in performance between NB and Logistic Regression (LR) in Q7? Referring to the number of parameters and assumptions underlying each model, provide one reason why NB might outperform LR, and one reason why LR might outperform NB. In your answer, refer back to the *Adult* data set used in this assignment. **[1 mark]**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)** Assume that you have access to a (hypothetical) infinitely large U.S. census database (i.e., an enormous version of the *Adult* data set used in this assignment). Is it true that Logistic Regression, but not Naive Bayes, will achieve perfect test set performance? Why (not)? **[1 mark]**\n",

    "\n",
    "(b)The uneven class distribution make the Accuracy is not good for evaluate the model. In the training data set, \"<50K\" has 24684 instances and  \">50K\" only has 7841. that is also a reason of why some model has higher accuracy but lower F1 score. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(c)NO, because Macro F1 average the Precision and Recall. For this situation, the bank manager wants to avoid falsely granting a loan to people who have less than 50k income. So it is important to predict whether \"<50\" is accurate, the Precision of the model should have a higher weight to evaluate the classifier model.\n",

If the continuous data is not discretized, the accuracy of the logistic regression model will be disturbed by outliers.\n",

    "LR outperform NB: base on the assumption of Naive Bayes, the feature should be independent of each other and all features should have the same weight.

Non-independent features have little effect on logistic regression.\n",
